**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, currently only available as an Android app. The Gaming Room would like to implement a version that serves multiple platforms. This document serves as a product summary and outline of the constraints that will affect the product, along with potential solutions.

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

I felt that I kept the documentation well organized and concise in each explanation.

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

It kept me focused on the task at hand without having to worry about any other possible features or any errors that may arise as a result of having to solve other issues.

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

I would revise the development requirements for the respective operating platforms, as I felt I did not go far enough into my explanations about Mac and Windows OS, as I favored Linux.

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

The central user need is functionality, so my main objective was to consider the expansion of operating platform with regard to making sure the functionality of the game was streamlined for the best user experience. The end user is the primary audience for your application and the product can not be successful if the users do not enjoy using the application.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**
My main approach was ensuring full functionality with attention paid to memory, storage, and system management. Serverless achitecture is a facet that I will definitely employ in future applications based on their potential for scability and future growth.
